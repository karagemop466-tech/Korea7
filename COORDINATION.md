# COORDINATION.md — shared task board

Shared task board for parallel agent sessions working in this repository.
Rules (from the project brief): read this file before starting; claim a task by
writing your session ID and file scope here, then commit and push the claim
immediately; never start a task another session has claimed; keep scopes
non-overlapping; make small frequent commits; run `git pull --rebase` before
every push; log requests to change files owned by another session here instead
of editing them; record sources, verification, and irregularities here when a
task is done; never mark anything verified without linking an official source.

Status values: `unclaimed`, `in progress`, `done`, `needs review`
(`needs review` = published on the site's "Flagged for Review" page; does not
block anything). If a claim is more than 60 minutes old with no commits, any
other session may take over and note the handoff in the log.

## Sessions

| Session ID | Branch | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `d5c5d85b` | `arena/d5c5d85b-korea7` | active | Arena session branch. Platform rules require all work on this exact branch, so the `session-<id>/<task>` branch-naming convention cannot be followed; this branch serves as the session's branch and this deviation is logged here per the conflict rules. |

## Task board

| ID | Task | Status | Owner session | File scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T1 | Repo review and irregularity log | in progress | `d5c5d85b` | `COORDINATION.md`, Flagged-for-Review page section |
| T2 | Source research and verification: problem description, three 2026-08-30 estimates, cost benchmarks, technical background (overflow/trip lever), San Francisco contractor candidates with reviews and license checks | in progress | `d5c5d85b` | `trip-lever/**` |
| T3 | GitHub Pages site build: landing page + category subpages (dashboard UI, table format) | in progress | `d5c5d85b` | `index.html`, `summary.html`, `estimates.html`, `contractors.html`, `findings.html`, `sources.html`, `flagged.html`, `assets/site.css`, `assets/site.js` |
| T4 | Line-by-line verification pass: every table row has an official source link; blanks + flags for unconfirmed values; internal + external link check | in progress | `d5c5d85b` | `trip-lever/verification.md` |
| T5 | Final integration: re-verify combined data, confirm site builds with no broken links, PR to `main`, merge, confirm GitHub Pages deploy, record PR link here | in progress | `d5c5d85b` | `COORDINATION.md` |

Shared outputs (site `index.html` and site navigation) are owned by the
integration task T5 (same session in this run — single-session execution).

## Log

- 2026-11-06 — `d5c5d85b` — Session start. `COORDINATION.md` did not exist; created it and claimed T1–T5 in a single non-overlapping scope. No other session had claimed anything at read time.
- 2026-11-06 — `d5c5d85b` — Repo review findings (T1, details published on the site's Flagged for Review page): (a) repository root content belongs to an unrelated legacy project (GEMS fault-prospectivity audit) and its site remains at `docs/`; (b) the new project's landing page takes over the site root `index.html`; (c) the three 2026-08-30 estimates are user-provided and cannot be confirmed from any official source — flagged unverified; (d) GitHub Pages is configured as legacy build from `main`, path `/`.
